# bank-churn-project
A deep dive into Customer Churn in Banking!

> **Goal:** Identify patterns and factors contributing to customer churn in a bank, and generate actionable insights using Excel, SQL, Python, and Power BI.

---

## 📊 Overview

Customer churn is a critical problem in the banking industry, as retaining customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project analyzes the behavior of over 10,000 bank customers to uncover why some leave and how the bank can prevent it.

This is a data analytics portfolio project showcasing my ability to work with real-world business problems, clean and analyze large datasets, create visual dashboards, and communicate insights clearly.
